This package contains computational kernel and tests for kriging a gaussian process.
Essentially, it performs interpolation (not polynomial) in a better (more robust using less computations) way than other methods.
If you've stumbled upon this project, please note that it is still in process of building, so do not rely on it too much. It will be better in the future.
